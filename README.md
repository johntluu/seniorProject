## RGB-D Face Recognition Evaluation
# There are three separate face recognition script and sbatch script pairs:
1. face_recognition.py, run.sbatch : This runs only the RGB-D face recognition.
2. rgbDepthFaceRecognition.py, runBoth.sbatch : This runs both the RGB and RGB-D face recognition scripts, with printing.
3. rgbDepthNoPrintFR.py, runNoPrint.sbatch : This runs both the RGB and RGB-D face recognition scripts, without printing.

# This should be cleaned up in the future.
